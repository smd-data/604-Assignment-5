    "text": "DACSS 603: Introduction to Quantitative Analysis\nFor my final project, I analyzed data from the 2021 American Family Survey to examine whether the amount of time a person spends caring for their children on their own influences their support for a higher Child Tax Credit. The hypothesis was that people who spend more time caring for their children are more likely to support a higher Child Tax Credit. A linear regression model was used to analyze the data. No significant effect of childcare hours on support for a higher tax credit was observed in the results of this analysis.\n603 Final Paper with Embedded Code\nInteractive Dashboard Presentation"
