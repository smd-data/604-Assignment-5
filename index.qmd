## Introduction

I am currently finishing my final semester as a graduate student at UMass Amherst studying Data Analytics and Computational Social Science (DACSS), and I will graduate in February 2026. I previously received a bachelor’s degree in psychology from UMass Lowell in May 2022. When I was an undergraduate student, I enjoyed my classes on research and statistics, and I wanted to continue studying these topics in graduate school, which led me to the DACSS program at UMass Amherst.
