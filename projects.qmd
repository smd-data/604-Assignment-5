This is a selection of projects that I have worked on during my time as a DACSS student:

## DACSS 603: Introduction to Quantitative Analysis

For my final project, I analyzed data from the 2021 American Family Survey to examine whether the amount of time a person spends caring for their children on their own influences their support for a higher Child Tax Credit. The hypothesis was that people who spend more time caring for their children are more likely to support a higher Child Tax Credit. A linear regression model was used to analyze the data. No significant effect of childcare hours on support for a higher tax credit was observed in the results of this analysis.
